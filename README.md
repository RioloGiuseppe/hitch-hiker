hitch-hiker
===========

Android project developed for a subject at university. It has no practical utility as it is written, it can be a good starting point for more serious projects.  The app relies on a server for data management and people who need a ride. A passenger may ask if there is someone nearby willing to give him a ride. He can decide after reading the feedback whether or not to accept. A passenger can decide which (if they like the offer), the driver must be picked up. After that the passenger is accompanied to the destination, users can issue feedback to describe the experience.
